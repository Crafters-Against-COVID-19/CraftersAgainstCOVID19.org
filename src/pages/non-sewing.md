We have a variety of non-sewing activities we could use your help with, including cutting, clerical, 3D printing, driving, and more. If you can help us with this, we’d be greatly appreciative.

If you are looking to help but this isn’t a good fit, we have other options. You could [help sew masks](/volunteer/sewing/), [donate materials to make masks](/volunteer/donate/), or [donate to our GoFundMe to pay for materials, gas, laundering, etc.](https://charity.gofundme.com/o/en/donate-widget/21157).

**Please do not sign up if you have shown any symptoms at all or have knowingly been exposed to Coronavirus!**
