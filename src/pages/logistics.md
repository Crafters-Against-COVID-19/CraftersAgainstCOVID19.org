![A bin full of completed masks, ready for delivery.](/images/bin.jpg)

In order to collect and distribute the materials to make the masks and the masks themselves, we rely on a network of Neighborhood Captains and drivers. If you can help us with this, we’d be greatly appreciative.

If you are looking to help but this isn’t a good fit, we have other options. You could [help sew masks](/volunteer/sewing/), [donate materials to make masks](/volunteer/donate/), or [donate to our GoFundMe to pay for materials, gas, laundering, etc.](https://www.gofundme.com/f/crafters-against-covid19-seattle).

**Please do not sign up if you have shown any symptoms at all or have knowingly been exposed to Coronavirus!**
