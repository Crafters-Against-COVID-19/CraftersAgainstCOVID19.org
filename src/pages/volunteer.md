Intro text here

## Can you sew?

If you can sew, we need your help. We will provide the pattern and instructions for making masks. We can also provide materials if you need them. If you’d like to help by sewing, please be prepared to sew at least 25 masks as we need to make sure we are using our limited resources efficiently.

## Do you want to help with meterials or logistics?

If you can’t sew or can’t commit to sewing at least 25 masks, you can help in other ways. We are looking for materials donations like cotton fabric and elastic. We are also looking for both divers and Neighborhood Captains to help with the collection and distribution of both supplies and masks.

## Do you want to help in other ways?

If you are looking to help but don't have the skills or resources to sew/donate material/distribute, [we have a GoFundMe campaign](https://www.gofundme.com/f/crafters-against-covid19-seattle). The money will be put towards materials, gas, laundering, etc.
