In order to keep our sewers sewing, we need materials. Please fill out the following form if you can donate any of the following **clean and unused** mask-making materials:

* **Elastic** - ½" or smaller, any color
* **Woven Cottons** - High thread count lightweight fabric. Hold it up to the window, if you can clearly see the shape of the window it’s too thin; we need woven cotton similar in weight to that of a nice dress shirt. Quilters cotton, cotton sateen, and **unused** high thread count sheets are also acceptable.
* **Cotton Flannel** - Must be cotton, but can be any print/color.
* **Bias Tape** - Must be cotton, but can be any color.
* **Wires** - Pipe cleaners, craft wire (moldable), etc. are all acceptable.
* **Laundry Soap** - Must be unscented & dye free.
