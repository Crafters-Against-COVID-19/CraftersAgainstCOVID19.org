If you can sew, we need your help. We will provide the pattern and instructions for making masks. We can also provide materials if you need them. If youâ€™d like to help by sewing, please be prepared to sew at least 25 masks as we need to make sure we are using our limited resources efficiently.

If you are looking to help but don't have the skills or resources to sew, you can donate materials, help with distribution, or donate to our GoFundMe to pay for materials, gas, laundering, etc.

**Please do not sign up if you have shown any symptoms at all or have knowingly been exposed to Coronavirus!**
