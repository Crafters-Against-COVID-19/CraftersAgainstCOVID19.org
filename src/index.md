![Handmade masks.](/images/masks.jpg)

Now is the time to get into action to and support the medical community! If you have a sewing machine and some basic skills you can help in a big way! We are creating masks for medical centers, hospice organizations, homelessness workers, etc. in the Seattle-area.

## Does your organization need help?

Please let us know what you need by <a href="mailto:CraftersAgainstCOVID19Seattle@gmail.com">emailing us</a>.

## Do you want to help out?

We have [many ways for you to participate directly](/volunteer/) or you can [donate cash via our GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/f/crafters-against-covid19-seattle).

Together we'll save thousands of lives!
