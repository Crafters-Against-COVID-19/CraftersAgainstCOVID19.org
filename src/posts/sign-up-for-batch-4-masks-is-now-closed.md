PLEASE READ THIS ALL THE WAY THROUGH AS THINGS ARE DIFFERENT THIS TIME AROUND!

We are excited to announce that we have kits with pre-cut masks coming early next week. Until then we want to get as many of you working as possible with the supplies you have, and the kits we have left.

We are opening TWO DIFFERENT SIGNUPS for those who have materials, and for those who need kits.

IF YOU HAVE MATERIALS: Please [sign up here](https://forms.gle/Cez5va62HKSUsZKt5). You do not need elastic to make this mask.

IF YOU NEED KITS: Please [sign up here](https://forms.gle/QqZhHGgdxB5ug5uY8). This time around we will only have kits available in Wallingford or Renton and for pickup only. Kits are extremely limited, and once we run out we will be turning submissions off, so please only sign up if you know you can complete to masks. This mask is identical to mask 2 which is more suited to intermediate to advanced sewists.

THANK YOU ALL!
