We want to give a round of applause to all of you who are still doing the work to get masks made and delivered! The demand is only going up, and you're all doing an incredible job. KEEP GOING!!!

We'd also like to celebrate the most amazing leadership team a group could have dreamed of working with on this incredible project: Candace Frank, Gwynedh Van Allan, Katie McKeller

Organizing all of this and managing the group is TOUGH WORK y'all and these three deserve a standing ovation.
