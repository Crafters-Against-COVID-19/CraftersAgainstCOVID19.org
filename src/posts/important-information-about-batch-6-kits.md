We just realized that we were going too fast to get these kits out to ya'll and we made a mistake.... So you'll be getting material with 25 cuts of A and 25 cuts of B.... when really you need 50 of each. We are so sorry! Please make what you can (12 total) and we will fix this error for the next round.

If you have fabric and want to cut out for the other 13 please do! You'll have enough wire and ties to finish them.

Again, thank you for your patience and awesomeness as we work through this chaotic time.
