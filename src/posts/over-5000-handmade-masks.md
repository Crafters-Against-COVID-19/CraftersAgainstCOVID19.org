By Tuesday we expect to have delivered over 5,000 handmade masks, and be well on our way to 10,000 more.

Because the demand for masks only seems to be growing we are expanding our [GoFundMe](https://www.gofundme.com/f/crafters-against-covid19-seattle) goal to get **even more** supplies to make **even more masks**!!!

Anything you can spare will make a life altering difference for those in need ❤️
