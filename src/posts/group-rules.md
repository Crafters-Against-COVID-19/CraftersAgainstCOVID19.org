The intention of Crafters Against COVID-19 Seattle is to align Seattle Metro area volunteers with materials and organizations in need to create thousands of highly-needed sewn masks.

With that in mind, we have updated our group rules. Please make sure your posts and comments/questions are aligned with this intention.

1. **KEEP ON TOPIC**. The intention of this group is to facilitate the making of large quantities of sewn masks for Seattle-area healthcare workers and orgs. This is not a place to ask questions about masks for personal use, or to buy/sell masks or materials.
2. **BE KIND AND PATIENT**. We understand that these are challenging and confusing times for all of us. Please be patient, and mindful of how much our leadership team is managing. Please be kind and welcoming to each other.
3. **USE OUR TIME WISELY**. Our patterns/videos are not proprietary and free for anyone to use. However, due the the timeliness of our local demand we cannot focus our energies on non-local or personal goals. Please take conversations/questions on outside goals elsewhere.
4. **NO PROMOTIONS OR SPAM**. Any self-promotions, or attempts to sell anything, will lead to you being quickly removed from the group.
