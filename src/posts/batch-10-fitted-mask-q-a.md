Good morning you wonderful crafters! This is the thread for questions for those of you working on Batch 10 (the fitted mask). Please read through all the comments before posting your question.

Here are some of the answers you may already be looking for:

* Kits for this mask were delivered yesterday, 4/24.
* The completion goal for this mask is Monday, 4/27.
* If you cannot complete your masks by then, no worries! Just let your Neighborhood Captain know so you can arrange a new date.
* Instructions for this mask can be found in the group files.
* These masks can ONLY be made with the approved materials listed in the instructions.
* All fabric yardage needs to be pre-washed on hot please.
* Elastic and ties are both threaded through the mask in the same way.
* Please knot the ends of all ties so they don't fray in the wash.
