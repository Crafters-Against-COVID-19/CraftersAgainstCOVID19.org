  "Thank you again Crafters Against COVID-19 Seattle! I went to our yogurt
  manufacturing plant yesterday to pick up my mask
  ![](https://static.xx.fbcdn.net/images/emoji.php/v9/t57/1/16/1f609.png) so
  that I could deliver our yogurt donation to Chef
  Tarik's[\#feedthepeople](https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/feedthepeople?epa=HASHTAG)
  community feeding program! It was great to see our employees abiding by our
  mask rules. We hope that our donation will be able to make more masks to
  benefit many more!!"
