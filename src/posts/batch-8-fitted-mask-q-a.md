Here are some answers to questions you may already have:
* The completion date for these masks is Monday, 4/20
* If you cannot complete by that date, please let us and your Neighborhood Captain know
* If you signed up for materials your Neighborhood Captain will be in touch today (please check your spam)
* If you don't have elastic please use fabric ties instead. All ties need to be finished on the ends.
* All masks need to be made using flat cotton or bamboo woven fabrics only.

If you have any other questions, please watch this [how to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lyg_Nb27jp8) and read through our [FAQ](https://craftersagainstcovid19.org/faq/) to see if you can find your answer before asking.
