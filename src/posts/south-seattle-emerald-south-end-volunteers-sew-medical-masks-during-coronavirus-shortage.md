One of the Southend SEWer volunteers, Liz Cruz, lives in Rainier Beach. She’d already been sewing homemade masks for several weeks to help out people who wanted them for non-medical situations, such as her partner, who works as a bus driver for King County Metro. Cruz soon connected with Breznau and Frank online.

“I’ve done a lot of sewing my whole life—apparel, costume design” Cruz said “I stocked up on fabric and just started.”

She’s sewn many of the non-medical masks and now has agreed to take on some of the kits, as well. Cruz has a job in human resources for Amazon and has been working from home since early in the outbreak. Sewing the masks provides a welcome relief.

“It’s so nice to step away from the computer and sew,” she said.
