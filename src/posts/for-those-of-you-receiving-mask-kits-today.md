We thankfully were able to get this new batch of masks donated and mass cut by [Prairie Underground](https://www.facebook.com/prairieunderground/).

THESE PIECES ARE CUT SPECIFICALLY TO ALLOW FOR SHRINKING AFTER MANUFACTURING.

This means you DO NOT CUT OR WASH THEM. Just follow the sewing instructions.

BEFORE YOU ASK:
* Do not worry about different sizes, just make everything you have.
* The material will become denser after sterilizing by the organization.
* Yes, the pleats are the same.

THANK YOU ALL!!!
