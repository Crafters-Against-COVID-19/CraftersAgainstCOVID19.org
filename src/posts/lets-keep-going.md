In light of the shelter in place, we want you to know that we are still committed to getting masks made and delivered!\
\
Our plan is to deliver kits for Mask 2 to everyone who indicated on their form they need supplies. We have a plan, and a backup plan to get these from you to those in need upon completion. THE NEW COMPLETION DATE IS FRIDAY, 3/27!!!\
\
We are cutting off sign ups for the first batch of kits, which will come out tomorrow. Those who sign up from now on and indicate they need materials will receive kits Wednesday.\
\
PLEASE DON'T QUIT! WE CAN STILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE!
