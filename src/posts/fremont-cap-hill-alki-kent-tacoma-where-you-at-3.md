Hello all you amazing and wonderful crafters! Thank you all for being here and making a difference!!!

We are looking for Neighborhood Captains to disperse kits and collect finished masks. This could be done from your porch, or a nearby grocery store parking lot, and will not require direct contact with anyone or any materials. However, we do ask that no immunocompromised individuals sign up for this one.

This is a great way to get involved if you want to help, but don't sew. Check out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdVS_CjAbCUGeveTvzdZF1GisuACm2a_ipjLIdo4vs2IziZIA/closedform) for more details.
