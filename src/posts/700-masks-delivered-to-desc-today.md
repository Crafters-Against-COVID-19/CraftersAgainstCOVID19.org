Our first mask donation as a group went to [Downtown Emergency Services Center (DESC](https://www.desc.org/)) to help them serve Seattle's homeless populations. 

The DESC provides integrated services including housing, emergency shelter, crisis intervention and healthcare to thousands of homeless and formerly homeless people every day. â€‹

We're so excited to have so many amazing Crafters united in making masks for those in need, and look forward to doing even more.
