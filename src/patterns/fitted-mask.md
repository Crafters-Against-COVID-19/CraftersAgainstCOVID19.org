This mask is fitted, with 2 layers of fabric and a pocket between them for an optional filter. **We are not making filters.** Elastic is threaded to fit around the head. Seam allowances are ¼" unless noted.

## What you will need

* 9" × 15" fabric outer layer
* 9" × 15" fabric lining layer
* 3" piece of soft wire (e.g., decorative wire, picture wire, pipe cleaners)
* Approximately 20" of elastic

You can choose any tightly woven cotton fabric you like. Hold it up to the light to see how tight the weave is. Use the same fabric for outer and lining if you want, or use different ones to help you remember which side is clean and which is dirty. Don't use stretchy, sequined or velvet material. Wash all fabrics before sewing to pre-shrink, and to assure you are working with the most sanitary materials possible.

*You can make 3 regular or large size masks of either design from ¼ yard (9") of 45" wide fabric.*

## How to make a mask

### Step One:

1. Fold outer fabric and cut two of pattern piece A. Fold lining fabric and cut two of pattern piece B.
2. Sew center curves of outer layers and right sides together.
3. Sew center curves of lining layers and right sides together.
4. Clip the curved seam at about ½" intervals but not down to the seam.
5. Fold seam allowance over to one side and top stitch down (for both lining and outer layer).

### Step Two:

6. Fold straight side edges of lining fabric in (wrong sides together) about ½", and sew fold down with straight stitch.
7. On outer layer side edges, fold top, bottom, and side edges in, using the dotted lines on the pattern and the transferred dots as guides. Pin. Ironing helps keep this in place.
8. Stitch along all the 3 folds on each side, ⅛" from fold.
9. Make the sleeves for the elastic—with wrong side up, fold stitched ends of outer layer up to the pencil line (dots). Stitch down.

### Step Three:

10. Lay inner layer over outer layer, right sides touching. Sew the top edge and the bottom edge.
11. Clip curved seam.
12. Turn right side out. Top stitch the top and bottom seams, ⅛" from edge. This will assure both layers stay in place during laundering.
13. Feed elastic through the sleeves to create an upper and lower strap. Feed each end of the elastic through the sleeves in a U shape. A safety pin can help feed it through.
14. Tie the ends of the elastic in a knot and slid knot into the channel on the side of the mask.

### Step Four:

15. Make a channel to hold the nose wire by stitching a line ¼" from the top stitch line, echoing the curve (2" on each side of Center Front Seam).
16. Slide a ~3" piece of wire into the slot created (loop the ends first with pliers if they are sharp).
17. Sew the ends of the channel closed.
