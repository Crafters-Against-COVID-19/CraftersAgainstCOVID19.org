## What you will need

* Cotton woven fabric, preferably a denser quilting cotton or sateen. In general, if you can hold it up to a light and not see the shape of the bulb it is dense enough.
* Elastic ½" or smaller (smaller is best)
* General purpose thread

**Please make ¾ of your masks for adults and ¼ for children!**

## How to make a mask

1. Cut rectangles (9"× 12" for adult) (7.5" × 10" for children).
2. Fold cotton in half with right sides together against the width of the fabric so it’s 6" × 9" (adult) or 5" × 7.5" (children).
3. Cut (2) elastic pieces (7.5" for adult, 6.5" for children). If you are using cord elastic knot the ends of the cord. Alternatively, cut 4 ties at least 20" long. If you need more details on making fabric ties please [watch this video](https://youtu.be/O298NkkQelw).
4. With fabric still folded, sandwich elastic or ties between the two layers so the cut edge comes out diagonally at the corners of the two short sides.

5. Stitch along the edges with a ⅝" seam allowance (approximately the width of your presser foot). Start along the left bottom corner, stitch to ½" from the center. Leave 1" open to turn your fabric right way out later. Start your stitch 2" away and go to the bottom right corner. Your stitch should start and stop with a machine backstitch.

6. Turn mask right side out, pull out the corners, and press. At the open area fold to match the stitched line.
7. Pin three ½" tucks at sides.
8. Top stitch from the bottom left corner, over the pleats. Stop and pivot at the corners. Continue until you meet the fold on the bottom right corner. Make sure your stitch covers the entire open area, and starts and stops with a back stitch.
