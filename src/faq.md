  - name: About Us
    faq:
      - q: Who are you?
        a: We are a team of 6 women living in the Seattle-area with rich backgrounds in
          management, clothing construction, and theatre production. Our goal is
          to put makers in line to have their contributions utilized directly by
          those who need them. We know this not only fulfills a need, but also
          gives our crafters a purpose during these challenging times.
      - q: How do you choose which organizations get masks?
        a: We choose our receiving organizations based on a criteria designed to ensure
          all masks will meet demand where they are needed most. We place
          projects in our queue based on location, need, and specifics of the
          mask request.
      - a: We don’t. Typically the organization knows what type of mask will work best
          for them better than we do.
        q: How do you choose which masks to make?
      - q: How can I decide which mask to make for my family?
        a: There are dozens of mask patterns and tutorials available on the internet.
          It’s up to you to decide what’s right for you and your people, we
          cannot make a specific recommendation.
      - q: Can I organize something like this in my town?
        a: Absolutely, and please do! We will try our hardest to share our experience
          with you and what we’ve found works best. Nothing that we’re doing is
          proprietary. Get out there and start saving lives!
  - name: Volunteering
    faq:
      - q: Do I need to live in Seattle?
        a: You need to live in the Seattle Metro area, encompassing Tacoma to the south,
          Lynnwood to the north, and Redmond to the east. We cannot currently
          serve those in the Puget Sound islands.
      - q: How do I sign up to sew?
        a: Sign up via the form in the announcements section of our Facebook Group. If
          the form is unavailable we have filled our pledge goal for the current
          project, and should have the next project posted within a few days.
      - q: What if I can’t sew?
        a: There are other ways to help. You can get involved as a driver, contribute
          materials you may have already, or donate to [our GoFundMe*(opens in a
          new
          window)*](https://www.gofundme.com/f/crafters-against-covid19-seattle).
      - q: How do I sign up for other volunteering opportunities?
        a: Sign up via the form in the announcements section of our Facebook Group.
          There you will see options for how you’d like to volunteer. If the
          form is unavailable we have filled our pledge goal for the current
          project, and should have the next project posted within a few days.
      - q: Do you need anything 3D printed?
        a: Currently we do not. We have seen tutorials about masks made from 3D printed
          frames, but haven’t had any demand from organizations looking for
          these.
  - name: Donations
    faq:
      - q: How are you paying for supplies?
        a: We’ve been thankful to receive numerous generous donations via our GoFundMe
          and from local fabric stores and costume shops. Still, supplies are
          expensive and demand for masks is only going up.
      - q: How can I donate to the cause?
        a: For monetary contributions check out [our GoFundMe*(opens in a new
          window)*](https://www.gofundme.com/f/crafters-against-covid19-seattle).
          We are also accepting good sized donations of elastic, wire, and
          tightly woven cotton fabrics. Generally we are looking for material
          donations large enough to make at least 50 masks (that’s roughly 25
          yards of elastic, 7 yards of fabric, or 6’ of wire). If you have
          materials in at least these quantities please contact
          [CraftersAgainstCovid19Seattle@gmail.com](mailto:CraftersAgainstCOVID19Seattle@gmail.com).
      - q: Do you want my sewing machine?
        a: We love that so many of you are thinking of every option available to
          contribute! Unfortunately, we don’t currently have the space or
          bandwidth to handle sewing machine donations.
  - name: Supplies
    faq:
      - q: What if I’m out of elastic?
        a: You can substitute elastic with ties on your masks. These ties will have to
          go behind the head, rather than behind the ears, so keep in mind you
          may need a lot more length. The best practice is to try one first and
          check the fit on yourself or your quarantine buddy. Ties can be made
          from shoelaces, ribbon, twill tape, or bias tape. If you don’t have
          any of those, try making your own with [this
          video](http://localhost:8080/faq/%5Bhttps://youtu.be/O298NkkQelw%5D(https://youtu.be/O298NkkQelw?fbclid=IwAR29MiUz8dGRXEiYV8tQqFL4pQBfJiRPqrmRbDC_40SEeIWPBib1ZujGZoU)).
      - q: What do I use if I don’t have wire?
        a: Pipe cleaners, jewelry wire, a thin paper clip. Some masks call for wire
          because the need to be formed to sit snuggly against the bridge of the
          wearer’s nose. If the material is bendable and formable, it should
          work.
      - q: Can I use other material to make my masks?
        a: We know there is a lot of information out there, much of it speculative,
          about how to add filtration to masks. While we appreciate the
          diligence to serving our frontline workers, the prescribed mask
          materials have specifically been dictated by the organizations using
          them, and we can’t currently accept any masks made from materials
          other than those listed.
      - q: Tight woven cotton? Does that mean I can use sheets/pillowcases?
        a: High thread count woven sheets and pillowcases do qualify, but only if they
          are unused. Right now none of our organizations are accepting masks
          made from recycled materials.
      - q: Should I pre-wash my fabric?
        a: Yes! Cottons typically shrink significantly in the wash, and sometimes have
          chemicals or finishers from the manufacturer. For these reasons we ask
          that you please prewash your fabrics on hot.
  - name: Sewing
    faq:
      - q: Where can I see a tutorial on making your current mask?
        a: Check out the announcements section of our Facebook group. There you will
          find a video tutorial, a live questions thread, and other useful
          information for your project.
      - q: Will you teach me how to sew?
        a: Timeliness is a very important factor in this situation, and we unfortunately
          cannot teach anyone how to sew for our mask projects. If you cannot
          sew and still want to help out, consider being a Neighborhood Captain,
          a driver, or just sharing our posts on your social media.
      - q: How can I get the pattern for the current project?
        a: Please look in the announcements section of our Facebook group for a PDF of
          our current pattern and instructions.
      - q: How accurate are your patterns?
        a: We are working from patterns chosen by the organizations accepting the masks.
          Before we share them with the sewests, we make a sample, check the
          pattern, alter language as needed, and make a tutorial video. Between
          the six people in our core team we have over 100 years of sewing
          experience. We have professionally sewn, run numerous costume shops,
          and have advanced degrees in fashion or costuming.
      - q: What if I think I find a pattern mistake?
        a: Even with a collective century of sewing and pattern making experience, we
          are still human and still make mistakes. If you think you’ve found a
          mistake in our pattern, please email us directly so we can take a
          look[CraftersAgainstCOVID19Seattle@gmail.com](mailto:CraftersAgainstCOVID19Seattle@gmail.com).
  - name: Distribution & Collection
    faq:
      - q: How can I get supplies?
        a: Sign up via the form in the announcements section of our Facebook Group. If
          the form is unavailable we have filled our pledge goal for the current
          project, and should have the next project posted within a few days. On
          the form select to indicate that you need supplies. We will deliver
          supplies in a kit, typically within two days (watch for announcements
          for exact timing). When the kit has been delivered to your porch we
          will text you to let you know. If you are in a building with secure
          entrance we may ask you to meet us outside.
      - q: How are completed masks collected?
        a: Towards the collection date you will receive an email from your Neighborhood
          Captain with exact collection details. From there you have two
          options. Typically you will drop your masks into a collection bin,
          either in a nearby parking lot, or on a porch. During your drop off
          please remain at least 6’ away from anyone, and don’t touch the bin,
          door, or anything else unnecessary. You can also elect to have your
          masks picked up directly from your porch. If you are immunocompromised
          we ask that you please choose porch pickup. From there we will pick up
          from 23 different neighborhood drops throughout the Seattle-area, and
          take them all to their final home organization.
      - q: What is a Neighborhood Captain?
        a: Neighborhood Captains are people who have volunteered to be responsible for
          distribution of kits, and pickups of finished masks. We have several
          protocols that make it possible to be a Neighborhood Captain without
          coming into direct contact with materials or fellow volunteers; still,
          we ask that no immunocompromised individuals sign up for this
          position.
