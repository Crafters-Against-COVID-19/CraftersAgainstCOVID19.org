        a: "We are a team of 6 women living in the Seattle-area with rich backgrounds in management, clothing construction, and theatre production. Our goal is to put makers in line to have their contributions utilized directly by those who need them. We know this not only fulfills a need, but also gives our crafters a purpose during these challenging times."
